# Ecdar-ProtoBuf
This repository is used to organize and maintain the Protocol Buffers used across the ECDAR modules.
The messages are used to communicate between the [Ecdar-GUI](https://github.com/Ecdar/Ecdar-GUI) and the two back-end model checks: [REVEAAL](https://github.com/Ecdar/Reveaal) and [J-ECDAR](https://github.com/Ecdar/j-Ecdar).
